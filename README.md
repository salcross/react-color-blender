# React Color Blender

A color palette generator that blends between the colors to create interesting gradients. Inspired by the mobile game Blendoku. Try it [here](https://salcross.github.io/react-color-blender).

## How to Use

### Corner Colors

Enter a hex code or CSS color name for each corner, or generate a random color.

### Background Color

Enter a hex code or CSS color name, or generate a random background. The 'random' function will not work if 'Prevent Random Background' is checked, which will also prevent the background color from changing if 'Randomize All' is selected.

### Other Settings

#### Height and Width

Change the height and width of the color grid. Higher numbers result in more gradual blending.

#### Color Shape

Choose from square, two types of rounded square, and circle for the shape of the colors.

#### Gap

Toggle a gap between the colors in the grid.

#### Show Hex

Toggle a hex value overlay over each color.
